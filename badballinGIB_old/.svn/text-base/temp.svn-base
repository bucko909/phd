\begin{proof}
It is clear that $u$ conjugates into $H$, let us pick any $\Gamma$-geodesic representing $wuw^{-1}$ for $v$. Form a geodesic quadrilateral in $\Gamma$ with sides $v$, $w_1$ (labelled $w$ and connecting the points $v$ and $vw$), $u$ and $w_2$ (labelled $w$ and connecting the points $1$ and $w$). Pick some geodesic $t$ connecting $1$ to $vw$, and we have divided the quadrilateral into 2 geodesic triangles.

Suppose that $y$ is on $w_1$ and corresponds to some point on $v$. Then since $w$ labels a geodesic, $d(v, y) = d(y, H) \le \delta + \epsilon$ and thus the meeting point on $w_1$ must lie at most $\delta + \epsilon$ from $v$. Similarly, if $y$ is on $w_2$ and $2$-correpsonds to some point on $v$, $d(1, y) \le 2\delta + \epsilon$.

For the first case, suppose some point on $u$ $2$-corresponds to a point on $v$. Since all points on $v$ must chain-correspond to a point on $w_1$ or $w_2$, or $2$-correspond to a point on $u$ which does not chain-correspond to a point on $w_1$ or $w_2$. All points on $w_1$ must also chain-correspond to points not on $w_2$ and vice-versa, so if $n$ and $m$ are the distances from $1$ and $v$ to the meeting points on $w_2$ and $w_1$ respectively we find

\begin{eqnarray*}
|v| & = & (|u| - (|w| - n) - (|w| - m)) + n + m \\
    & = & |u| - 2|w| + 2n + 2m.
\end{eqnarray*}

We know that $|w| \ge n + m \le 3\delta + 2\epsilon$, so we can derive $|v| \le |u| - 2|w| + 6\delta + 4\epsilon$ and $|v| \le |u| + 3\delta + 2\epsilon$. Similarly, $|v| \ge n + m$ so we obtain 

\begin{eqnarray*}
2|w| & = & |u| - |v| + 2n + 2m \\
     & \le & |u| + 3\delta + \epsilon.
\end{eqnarray*}

This is everything we need to be in the first case.

Now suppose that at most one point on $u$ chain-corresponds to a point on $v$. Then clearly all points on $u$ chain-correspond to points on $w_1$ or $w_2$, and $|u| \le 2\epsilon + 3\delta$ as required by the second two cases. If $|u| > 2\delta$ then it remains to show we are in the final case.

Note that if a point $p$ on $w_1$ corresponds to a point $p'$ on $t$ which corresponds to a point $q$ on $w_2$ then $d(v, p) - 2\delta \le d(1, q) \le d(v, p) + 2\delta$, otherwise we can find a path from $1$ to $p$ or from $h$ to $q$ which is shorter than $w$, contradicting the fact that $w$ is a geodesic in $\Gamma'$. We can use the sorrespondances to show that

\begin{eqnarray*}
|t| - |w| &  =  & d(1, q) - |w| + |t| - d(1, q) \\
          &  =  & d(1, q) - |w| + d(vw, p') \\
          &  =  & d(1, q) - |w| + d(vw, p) \\
          &  =  & d(1, q) - d(v, p) \\
          & \le & 2\delta
\end{eqnarray*} so $|w| - 2\delta \le |t| \le |w| + 2\delta$, and we find the meeting point $m$ on $u$ must have

\begin{eqnarray*}
d(w, m) &  =  & \frac{|u| + |t| - |w|}{2} \\
        & \le & \frac{|u|}{2} + \delta
\end{eqnarray*} and similarly $d(vw, u) \le \frac{|u|}{2} + \delta$. Now it is clear that the points $a$ on $w_1$ and $b$ on $w_2$ at distance $i = \floor{\frac{|u|}{2}} - \delta$ from $vw$ and $w$ respectively correspond to points on $u$ at most $2\delta + 1$ apart. So we have $d(a, b) \le 5\delta + 1$ and letting $u'$ be a word labelling a path between $a$ and $b$, we have $u = w(-i)u'w^{-1}(i)$ as required.

It is clear that $u$ conjugates into $H$, so we can pick any $\Gamma$-geodesic representing $wuw^{-1}$ for $v$. Form a geodesic quadrilateral in $\Gamma$ with sides $v$, $w_1$ (labelled $w$ and connecting the points $v$ and $vw$), $u$ and $w_2$ (labelled $w$ and connecting the points $1$ and $w$). Pick some geodesic $t$ connecting $1$ to $vw$, and we have divided the quadrilateral into 2 geodesic triangles.

Suppose that $y$ is on $w_1$ and corresponds to some point on $v$. Then since $w$ labels a geodesic, $d(v, y) = d(y, H) \le \delta + \epsilon$ and thus the meeting point on $w_1$ must lie at most $\delta + \epsilon$ from $v$.

Since all points on $v$ must chain-correspond to a point on $w_1$ or $w_2$, or $2$-correspond to a point on $u$ which does not chain-correspond to a point on $w_1$ or $w_2$. All points on $w_1$ must also chain-correspond to points not on $w_2$ and vice-versa, so if $n$ and $m$ are the distances from $1$ and $v$ to the meeting points on $w_2$ and $w_1$ respectively we find

\begin{eqnarray*}
|v| & = & (|u| - (|w| - n) - (|w| - m)) + n + m \\
    & = & |u| - 2|w| + 2n + 2m \\
	& \le & |u| - 2|w| + 6\delta + 4\epsilon \\
	& \le & |u| + 3\delta + 2\epsilon
\end{eqnarray*} and from the second line, we can rearrange to find

\begin{eqnarray*}
2|w| & = & |u| - |v| + 2n + 2m \\
     & \le & |u| + 3\delta + \epsilon
\end{eqnarray*} with the last lines in both being due to the fact that $2|w| \ge n + m \le |v|$. This is everything we need to be in the first case.

Now suppose that at most one point on $u$ chain-corresponds to a point on $v$. Then clearly all points on $u$ chain-correspond to points on $w_1$ or $w_2$, and $|u| \le 2\epsilon + 3\delta$ as required by the second two cases. If $|u| > 2\delta$ then it remains to show we are in the final case.

Note that if a point $p$ on $w_1$ corresponds to a point $p'$ on $t$ which corresponds to a point $q$ on $w_2$ then $d(v, p) - 2\delta \le d(1, q) \le d(v, p) + 2\delta$, otherwise we can find a path from $1$ to $p$ or from $h$ to $q$ which is shorter than $w$, contradicting the fact that $w$ is a geodesic in $\Gamma'$. We can use the correspondances to show that

\begin{eqnarray*}
|t| - |w| &  =  & d(1, q) - |w| + |t| - d(1, q) \\
          &  =  & d(1, q) - |w| + d(vw, p') \\
          &  =  & d(1, q) - |w| + d(vw, p) \\
          &  =  & d(1, q) - d(v, p) \\
          & \le & 2\delta
\end{eqnarray*} so $|w| - 2\delta \le |t| \le |w| + 2\delta$, and we find the meeting point $m$ on $u$ must have

\begin{eqnarray*}
d(w, m) &  =  & \frac{|u| + |t| - |w|}{2} \\
        & \le & \frac{|u|}{2} + \delta
\end{eqnarray*} and similarly $d(vw, u) \le \frac{|u|}{2} + \delta$. Now it is clear that the points $a$ on $w_1$ and $b$ on $w_2$ at distance $i = \floor{\frac{|u|}{2}} - \delta$ from $vw$ and $w$ respectively correspond to points on $u$ at most $2\delta + 1$ apart. So we have $d(a, b) \le 5\delta + 1$ and letting $u'$ be a word labelling a path between $a$ and $b$, we have $u = w(-i)u'w^{-1}(i)$ as required.
